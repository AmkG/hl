Webpage source files are all `*.txt` files.  All `*.txt` files
in this directory will be automatically built by the `Makefile`.
The source files themselves have a specific format.

The first line of the source is the title line.  This forms the
title line of the webpage built from that source.

The second line of the source is the crumbs line.  This line is
a series of space-separated names.  The names must correspond to
actual `.txt` files in this directory.  For example, the crumbs
line for `legit-global-vars.txt` is `index book legit`.  This
means that the crumbs line is to the webpage generated for
`index.txt`, then the webpage for `book.txt`, and finally to the
webpage for `legit.txt`.  The crumbs line is the line at the top
of the webpage which shows the "higher" hierarchies of the web
site.

The content itself is in [Markdown Syntax][1].  Links to other
pages within the site have to use the `.html` extensions.

There is *no* checking if links within the site are valid: make
sure to double check because broken links to within-site pages
are just **bad**, **bad**, **bad**.

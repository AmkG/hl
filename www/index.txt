About `hl`
==========

`hl` is a general-purpose Lisplike language with an emphasis on getting
code written by diverse people, with diverse programming styles, easily
shared; in particular, it allows various libraries to provide their own
syntax without conflicting with other libraries.  The `hl` project is an
open source project (under an MIT license) which will provide a virtual
machine with a process-based concurrency model for `hl`.

The current state of this project is "[**being built**](dev-status.html)".
However, a draft document about `hl` is [currently
available](book.html).  You may also be interested in the [goals for the
project](goals.html).  Since it's being built we don't have a
distributable package yet but you may be interested in perusing the
[source code repository](http://github.com/AmkG/hl/commits/).

<small>This project is under the dictatorship of Alan Manuel K. Gloria,
who would like to dictate only the bit about the axioms and standard
library as much as possible.  Stefano Dissegna is credited for the
enormous work in adapting the interpreter from a previous project,
[SNAP](http://github.com/AmkG/snap/commits/master), revamping and
improving that interpreter, as well as convincing Alan to do this
project in the first place.  If you're interested in the project,
contact [Alan Manuel K. Gloria](mailto:almkglor@gmail.com).</small>

What `hl` wants
===============

* `hl` wants to be a Lisplike: it has **macros.**  Support for
  hygienic macros is being considered (once we figure out what
  it is and why it's not non-hygienic), but `hl` definitely has
  non-hygienic macros.  It wants to be a *hot Lisplike.*
* `hl` wants to be **paradigm-agnostic.**  You think functional
  programming is the best thing since sliced bread?  Go ahead;
  it has its advantages.  You can't think in terms of monads?
  Then mutate the data structures as much as you want.  `hl`
  seeks to support what you want: it wants to be a *hacker's
  language.*
* `hl` wants to have **process-based concurrency.**  This allows
  it to adapt to the new multicore processors, while still
  meeting its other goals - especially goals that conflict with
  the pure functional paradigm.  It wants to be able to handle
  *huge loads.*
* `hl` wants to try out the **actor model.**  Not just bland
  process-based concurrency, but having your objects **be**
  independently-running processes.  This means that `hl` will
  garbage collect processes that are waiting for something to
  do, but which everyone else has forgotten: processes are just
  another data structure!  In other words, it wants to support
  *hoards of lambdas.*
* `hl` wants to support **free and open source.**  Not just the
  implementation: `hl` wants to make it easy to **integrate other
  people's libraries** to your own project - libraries which may
  have been written in a **paradigm you are unaware of,** or are
  even **hostile to.**  It would like to gain a *huge set of
  libraries.*
* `hl` wants to support **generic programming.**  The type of
  objects - whether built-in or user-defined - is just a name;
  what's important is **what operations the type supports.**
  `hl` wants to have a type system based on capabilities,
  ducking the issue of inheritance; it wants to be *high-level.*

`HL` Legal Specifications: Axiomatic Layer
==========================================

The lowest layer of the base system is the Axiomatic layer, which
is composed completely of non-overrideable special forms.  These
special forms are recognized by a compliant `hl` compiler.

All members of the Axiomatic Layer begin with the prefix
`<axiom>`.  All members of the Axiomatic Layer are special forms
directly recognized by the compiler.  Macros assigned to the
global variable value of these symbols are ignored by the
compiler.

Since these symbols act as special forms, they cannot be passed
around as first-class functions; in order to work as such, they
must be wrapped in an actual function.

The Axiomatic Layer is the only layer that contains any special
forms (aside from any implementation-specific symbols in
`<impl>`, which are not specified anyway); any "special forms" to
the general user of the language are really macros.

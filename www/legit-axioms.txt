`HL` Legal Specifications: Axiomatic Layer
==========================================

The lowest layer of the base system is the Axiomatic layer, which
is composed completely of non-overrideable special forms.  These
special forms are recognized by a compliant `hl` compiler.

All members of the Axiomatic Layer begin with the prefix
`<axiom>`.

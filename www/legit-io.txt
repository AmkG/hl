`HL` Legal Specifications: Input and Output
===========================================

No man is an island, and neither is any machine, no matter how
virtual.  Data from the outside world must be able to enter the
machine, and the machine, to be useful, must be able to
manipulate some aspect of its environment, if only by emitting
data.

Thus, `hl` must support an input/output interface to allow the
hosted processes to communicate with the outside world.

The `hl` I/O subsystem is handled, at the lower levels, by the
[Event System](legit-event.html).  At the low level, I/O
operations are non-blocking.  At higher levels, it is possible
to choose between a blocking, synchronous interface for
simplicity, or to use an asynchronous, message-based interface.

(This section is not yet finished.  However, the low-level
details are described in the [Event System
documentation](legit-event.html))

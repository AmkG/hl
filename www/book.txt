The `HL` Book
=============

The `HL` Book is split into three sections, Legal, Moral, and
Practical.

1.  [The Legal Specifications](legit.html)
    - What you *can* do.
2.  The Moral Style Guide
    - What you *should* do.
3.  The Practical Reference
    - What you *want to* do.

The Legal Specifications
------------------------

The [`HL` Legal Specifications](legit.html) is the prose
specifications for the `hl` virtual machine.  An `hl`
implementation is a compliant `hl` implementation if it follows
the prose specifications.

The Moral Style Guide
---------------------

The `HL` Moral Style Guide is a set of recommended coding style
practices in order to ease the interchange of source code among
programmers using `hl`.  An `hl` programmer is a good programmer
if he or she follows the coding style.  An `hl` programmer is an
excellent programmer if she or he is able to recognize and
articulate when the recommended coding style is lacking and/or
should not be used.

The Practical Reference
-----------------------

The `HL` Practical Reference is a set of manuals for using
various common libraries included in an `hl` implementation.
An `hl` community is a good community if it can create libraries
which work seamlessly with the common libraries to extend them,
and if it is able to point out flaws in the libraries and correct
them.

The following functions/macros must be implemented in order to
bootstrap hl2b. They're shown together with their dependencies on the
right. The type (function or macro) is shown on the left together
with its current status (implemented/not implemented).

- [m][ ] def -- fn do
- [m][ ] do
- [m][ ] mac -- fn do
- [m][ ] if
- [m][ ] and -- if
- [m][ ] or -- if
- [f][ ] no
- [m][ ] each -- w/uniq let maptable afn alist when isa for
- [f][ ] load -- w/infile w/uniq whiler read eval
- [f][ ] string
- [f][ ] unpkg
- [m][ ] = -- ; depends if it has to be supported completely
- [m][ ] w/infile -- infile after close
- [m][ ] let -- fn
- [m][ ] with -- fn map
- [m][ ] withs -- fn let
- [m][ ] fn
- [m][ ] afn -- fn
- [f][ ] require -- load
- [m][ ] w/uniq -- uniq
- [f][ ] coerce
- [f][ ] +
- [m][ ] push -- w/uniq let atwiths setforms
- [f][ ] listtab -- let map fn
- [m][ ] givens -- withs
- [m][ ] make-br-fn
- [m][ ] ++ -- isa w/uniq let atwiths setforms
- [f][ ] acons
- [f][ ] ssyntax
- [f][ ] isnt -- no is
- [f][ ] caris -- and acons is
- [m][ ] in -- let or w/uniq
- [f][ ] type
- [f][ ] isa -- is type
- [f][ ] alist

To be completed....

You can now run simple hl programs.

Requirements:
 - a working, updated, hl-arc-f
 - a system where you can create and write a file called "/tmp/hl-tmp"

the last requirement is obviously temporary and will disappear in future versions.

To run a program saved in a file, type (within this directory):

  $ hl-arc-f compiler.arc your-file.hl

if everything is ok, the result of the last expression will be printed.

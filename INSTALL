Quick Install
-------------

To install `hl`, use the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install # and enter password

Requirements
------------

`hl` requires the following libraries:

1.  Boost C++ libraries
    - High-quality C++ libraries
    - from http://www.boost.org/
    - known to compile from at least 1.35.0 upwards
    - You can use the `--with-boost=/path/to/boost` option
      to specify the path where you have extracted Boost:
      e.g. `./configure --with-boost=~/packages/boost_1_35_0/`

`hl` has been developed on a Linux environment, but we hope to
have it portable across multiple operating systems, with priority
for reasonably POSIX systems.  If it somehow doesn't compile,
please consider it a bug for now.

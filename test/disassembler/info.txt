This directory tests the `hl` bytecode disassembler.
This tests the disassembler by assembling a bytecode
sequence, then disassembling that bytecode sequence and
checking that it's still (mostly) the same.

To run the tests in this directory:

	./compile_driver
	../reader/dotest.pl ./driver tests/

The above test should print a bunch of "Test X ...ok"
messages.  If any fail, the test will show which one failed.

Inside the `tests/` directory is some sample `hl` bytecode
sequences together with expected disassembly.  The format
of the test files is described briefly in `doc/dotest.txt`.

The test seems to work on any GNU/Linux system.

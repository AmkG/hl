This tests the bytecode interpreter ("executor").  Since it
assembles bytecode sequences, it also implicitly tests the
assembler.

In practice, much of the current testing (February 28, 2009)
ends here: the bytecode interpreter is effectively the part
that integrates the most of the existing `hl` codebase.

In order to run the tests in this directory:

	./compile_test
	../reader/dotest.pl ./run_bytecode tests/

The test should display a bunch of "Test X ...ok" messages.
If there are any errors, the test will show the failing test.

This appears to work on any GNU/Linux system.

The `tests/` directory contains several tests for the
bytecode interpreter.  The format of the test files is
described in `doc/dotest.txt`.

The `tests/` directory contains the following files:

	globals.test

Tests for global variable setting and reading.

	math.test

Tests for mathematics with integers and floats.

	t1.test

Various tests for various random bytecodes.

	t2.test

Tests for `reducto` and fail-test for assembly syntax.
(specifically, `(float asymbol)`)

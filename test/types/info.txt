This test directory tests various hl-side types, as defined
in `inc/types.hpp`.

To run the tests in this directory:

	./compile_test inclusion_test.cpp # ignore executable of this test
	./compile_test keys_table_test.cpp
	./a.out
	./compile_test string_test.cpp
	./a.out
	./compile_test tables_test.cpp
	./a.out

The first test is simply a sanity test of the include file
for types.  The last three tests all use `assert()` to check
for errors.

`keys_table_test.cpp` is an incomplete test of getting table
keys.

`string_test.cpp` is a comprehensive test of strings.

`tables_test.cpp` is a mostly-complete test of tables,
including lookup, insertion, and deletion.

This test appears to run on GNU/Linux systems.

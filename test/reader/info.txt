The test in this directory tests the C++-side reader, which
reads in the bytecode sequences.

To run the tests in this directory:

	./compile_test1
	../dotest.pl ./test1 tests/

The tests should display some "Test X ...ok" messages if no
failures occur.  If failures occur, the test will display
the exact failed test.

On almkglor's GNU/Linux system, tests fail in inputting some
floating point numbers.  It is possible that this is due to
locale settings.

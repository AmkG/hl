This directory tests the `hl` asynchronous I/O framework.

Here are the tests in this directory:

`niaw`
------

The `niaw` test is a `cat`-lookalike program which reads stdin and
writes to stdout.  Try using it in replacement of `cat`.  Inputting
directly from a terminal should work properly, and the CPU
consumption should be very near 0 while waiting for keyboard.

`niaw` should work with disk files, pipes, and `mkfifo`-pipes.

Another test that can be done on `niaw` would be to put it as a
CGI program in a webserver, then accessing it via a slow
connection.

To compile the test, use:

	./compile_niaw

Note that the script file currently assumes that you want the
POSIX I/O and signal system.

niaw.hlbc occasionally segfaults.

The segfault tends to happen for large files/inputs

The problem always occurs on the closure-ref directly after an event-wait.
It's a heisenbug, breaking at apparently random moments of time.
Badly enough, it's a heisenbug even in a -Dsingle_threaded build; possibly
the randomness is from the OS scheduling various processes.

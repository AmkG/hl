This directory tests very basic garbage collector
functionality; strictly, the tests in `../types/` are
effectively a superset of this, but if tests fail in both
this directory and in `../types/`, it may be easier to find
the bug here.

To run the tests in this directory:

	./compile_test inclusion_test.cpp
	# notice we don't execute inclusion_test.cpp
	./compile_test instantiation_test.cpp
	./a.out

`inclusion_test.cpp` is intended to check for compilation
errors in the headers.  `instantiation_test.cpp` is intended
for testing that garbage collection works for small-scale
allocation.  The test should output some adresses of data
structures at various stages of allocation; exactly
understanding those numbers requires knowledge of almkglor's
`heaps.cpp`.  The test includes some `assert()`'s though.

This directory contains tests for various components of hl.

Each directory contains its own "info.txt" file.  This file
describes how to perform the tests in that directory.

Most of these directories make sense only in the context of
the developer's dev environment: They tend to assume GNU,
probably assume GNU/Linux, and they all need GCC.  More
portable tests are probably possible but we're still at the
stage at which we're trying to get `hl` to run at all.

The most interesting test directory would be `executors/`.
This directory tests the project's bytecode interpreter.  The
interpreter is going to be quite a core component, and often
is the part where everything is then "integrated".  Soon we
will put up some documentation on the bytecodes.

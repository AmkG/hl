Performance tests. Currently because of debugging purposes the process GC is 
triggered often and each process has a really low timeslice (1 function call).
With the right values, performance is much better.

To run a test, type (within this directory):

$ time ../src/hl --bc test.hlc

Files:
  - recursion.hlc: test of a recursive function 
                   that calls itself 10000000 times

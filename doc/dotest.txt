dotest.pl is a simple Perl script that takes 2 arguments:

1) the test program ro tun
2) the directory where to find the tests for the program

the test directory is searched for files with the "test" extension. Each file 
may contain one or more tests. A test file has the following structure:

<input for the program>
<it can span multiple lines>
;<regex>

; *** Whatever you like

Everything before ;<regex> is put in a single file that is then passed to the 
test program. The output is then matched with <regex> (a valid Perl regular 
expression). If the match fails, the error is reported.
To separate different tests in a single file, you have to use the separator
line "; ***". Note that it must be placed at the start of the line, and that 
the space must be there. After the third "*" the rest of the line is ignored.

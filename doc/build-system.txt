The build system is based on autotools. External dependency checks and global 
configuration go into the file 'configure.ac'. Build targets (executables, 
libraries), their sources and optional arguments to the compiler go into the
Makefile.am present in every directory. An custom 'autogen.sh' runs autotools.

To build the Makefiles, from the toplevel directory, type:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --with-boost-prefix=/path/to/boost/include
